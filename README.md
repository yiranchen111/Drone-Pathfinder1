# Drone Flight Path Guidance System

This project provides an automated system that generates flight path guidance for a drone based on images captured during the flight. The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to analyze images of urban areas, generate flight instructions, and save the results to an Excel file.

# Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `torch`
- `PIL` (Pillow)
- `openai`
- `pandas`
- `io`
- `base64`
- `os`



# Setup
1. API Key for OpenAI
You need an API key from OpenAI to use the GPT-4 model. Replace the api_key in the generate_instructions function with your actual key.
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",  
    base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1"
)

2. Prepare Image Directory
The program expects images to be in a folder named images/. Place your drone images (captured during the flight) in this directory.

3. Excel Output File
The program will save the generated instructions in an Excel file (output.xlsx). Ensure that the file is either empty or already exists before running the script.

Usage
1. Place Images in the images/ Directory
The script will process each image in the images/ directory. Ensure the images are in a format that can be processed (e.g., .jpg, .png).

2. Run the Script
Execute the script in your Python environment. The script will process each image, convert it to a base64 format, send it to the OpenAI API for instruction generation, and save the output in output.xlsx.



3. Output File
After execution, check the output.xlsx file. It will contain the following columns:

index: The index of the image in the directory.

image_name: The name of the image file.

output_instructions: The flight instructions generated by GPT-4 based on the image.


Example Output
For each processed image, the following type of instructions might be generated:


Step 1: Begin your flight near the cluster of taller buildings with red brick facades and large windows. These buildings are surrounded by streets on all sides, providing a clear area for takeoff.
Step 2: Proceed towards the area with a mix of both red and beige buildings, maintaining a steady altitude to capture the architectural diversity.
...
The guidance text will be formatted in steps and provide insights into the flight path, such as identifying objects, locations, and where to pause during the flight.

# Troubleshooting
API Key Error: Ensure that your OpenAI API key is correctly set up. If you don't have one, you can get it from OpenAI.

Image Processing Error: The script resizes images to a 512x512 dimension before processing. If you encounter errors, check that the images are in a supported format and the path is correct.
